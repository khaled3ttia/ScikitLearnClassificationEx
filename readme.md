# Evaluation of different classification algorithms using scikitlearn

In this simple evaluation, labelled input data "data.csv" is given with column 14 as the target label. Additional data set "futures.csv" is needed to have the labels predicted (unlabelled data). A classification model is trained using "data.csv" and then labels for "futures.csv" are predicted using the same model. A set of classification algorithms are evaluated and the one with highest accuracy is used to predict the labels for "futures.csv". A detailed report showing all steps is available. A jupyter notebook shows the code used.
